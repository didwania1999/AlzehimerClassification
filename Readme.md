Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex multifactorial neurodegenerative disorder and is the most common type of dementia, defined by extensive neuronal and synapses loss (Tan et al., 2013; Gao et al., 2016). Recent study has shown that AD has high prevalence of an estimated 40 million patients worldwide (Selkoe and Hardy, 2016). Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) has been generally viewed as an intermediate state between normal aging and the onset of AD (Petersen et al., 2001; Garc√©s et al., 2014). Thus, AD and MCI, the transitional stage between the healthy aging and dementia, which commonly characterized by slight cognitive deficits but largely intact activities of daily living (Petersen, 2004; Wei et al., 2016), have been greatly interested.
